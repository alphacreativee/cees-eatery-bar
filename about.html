                oining Adrian is Christian Corachea, a talented chef from the
                Philippines who has made his mark in Ho Chi Minh City’s vibrant
                culinary scene before finding his home at Cee's Eatery & Bar.

                bringing a global perspective to our menu. His addition to our
                team adds depth and authenticity to our Latin American- inspired
                dishes.
